- use `bower install` for fetching components like bootstrap, jquery, angular etc.
- use [Flask Assets](http://flask-assets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) once it
  comes to minification
- keep track of python deps using `pip freeze >requirements.txt`
- REST validation with `reqparse` from `flask_restful`
